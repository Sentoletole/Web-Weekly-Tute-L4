            <p>As for my primary education I studied at Methodist College (Colombo 3) from nursery to AL's.</p>
            <p>Now I am a 2nd year student at IIT (Informatics Institute of Technology) following the BSc. in Computer Science
                 degree, offered by the University of Westminster.</p>
            <p>I am a passionate and detail-oriented individual with experience in web 
                design and development, including skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My 
                courseworks have also covered Python and Java, further broadening my 
                technical expertise. As a batch representative and team member, I enjoy 
                collaborating and organizing tasks effectively.
                My interests in DevOps, Business Analytics, Bioinformatics, and
                 Biostatistics have been supported by workshops on AWS, Docker,
                  Google Cloud, and Azure. Additionally, I served as a moderator for iTV
                   at Cutting Edge, which enhanced my communication skills.
                Outside of my technical work, I am involved in the choir Vocal Impact
                 and the Toastmasters Club at IIT, reflecting my love for music and public 
                 speaking. I am dedicated to learning and improving, aiming to contribute 
                 positively to any project I am involved in. </p>
